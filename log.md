# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: March 11th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Didn't really know what to do, so I just tried to mess around with the code and see where it took me. I ended up making a snowman of sorts. I couldn't get the js to work. I need to work on that.
